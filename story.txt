One day, Tom and Jerry walked  in the forest. A monkey snatched Jerry's hat.

Jerry asked Tom to Help him get his hat back, but Tom didn't want to help Jerry because
Jerry have poked fun at Tom his whole life. To get his hat back, Jerry lied to Tom if
Tom helps him for the last time, then he won't do any mean things to Tom anymore.
Poor Tom trusted what Jerry told him and tried to help Jerry.

Tom helped jerry but jerry with his mallicious intents took the hat after tom retrived it
and stole the wallet of tom and ran away like he always does.
