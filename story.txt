One day, Tom and Jerry walked  in the forest. A monkey snatched Jerry's hat.

Jerry asked Tom to Help him get his hat back, but Tom didn't want to help Jerry because
Jerry have poked fun at Tom his whole life. To get his hat back, Jerry lied to Tom if
Tom helps him for the last time, then he won't do any mean things to Tom anymore.
Poor Tom trusted what Jerry told him and tried to help Jerry.

Tom helped jerry but jerry with his mallicious intents took the hat after tom retrived it
and stole the wallet of tom and ran away like he always does.

Nine years later, the tale continues. Tom and Jerry became very distant of each other.
Tom was angry that Jerry stole his wallet and Jerry has now grown up to be a mature adult.
They encounter each other at the supermarket and immediately stare at each other wondering "is that him".
Once Jerry figures out its Tom, Jerry approaches Tom and apologizes for the past.
Tom once again accepts his apology unknowing of whats to come next.
